# wilhelm

wilhelm is a tiny app that works like [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray), but with only a third of the features. I built it because I love Ray and wanted to learn how it works. It's built with Node.js and WebSockets.

If you need a serious debugging tool, please use [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray) – it's awesome!
