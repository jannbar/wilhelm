# wilhelm

> Named after the inventor of the x-ray, Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen

wilhelm is a tiny app that works like [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray), but with only a third of the features. I built it because I love Ray and wanted to learn how it works. It's built with Node.js and WebSockets.

It has partial support for the `ray` function provided by spatie/ray.
These Ray methods are supported so far:

- `ray()`
- `ray()->charles()`

If you need a serious debugging tool, please use [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray) â€“ it's awesome!
